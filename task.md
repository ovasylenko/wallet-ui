# Frontend Coding Challenge

## Requirements

We are looking for people who can build awesome products so we created this
challenge to test your developer skills. We are looking for a creative mind
that can bring together the best practices and UX.

We'd like you to create a React wallet that can handle different currencies
(USD, EUR, CHF, etc) and exchange them between each other.

E.g. John Doe's wallet (Default currency = USD)

- USD balance: 100 USD
- EUR balance: 500 EUR
- CHF balance: 10000 CHF
- Totalised value in USD = 10237.79 USD

Users will be able to exchange from one currency to the other one. Hence, John can decide to exchange his
100USD to his Euro account. After the conversion, he will end up having:

_Considering 1 EUR = 1.24 USD_

- USD balance: 0 USD
- EUR balance: 580.42 EUR
- CHF balance: 10000 CHF
- Totalised value in USD = 10684.50 USD

The app should have the following features:

- Exchange between currencies
- Deposit a currency
- Show balance of each currency
- Show totalised value (across all your currencies) in the user's default currency
- Allow user to change default currency

### Bonus (optional)

- Add new currencies
- Transaction history when user deposits or exchanges money
- Add unit and UI tests
- Include animations

## Advice

- **Try to design and implement your solution as you would do
for real production code**. Show us how you create clean, maintainable code.
Build something we'd be happy to contribute to. This is not a programming contest
where dirty hacks win the game.

### Criteria

Your submission will be judged based on the following criteria:

- React modern practices
- Code reusability (try making reusable components)
- Asynchronous programming
- Error handling
- Consistency of coding style
- Test coverage
- Accesibility
- Responsiveness
- Design style and UX
- Bonuses

### Notes

- Language: Use React and feel free to use any library you
think helps with organising, writing better code, managing
states (Redux preferred), etc.
- Deliverables:
  - Share repo (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc)
  - Document the exact steps to run the app and describe libraries used and
    why you have chosen them. Feel free to comment any additional ideas.
  - Bonus Points: Deploy the app to Heroku or S3 and include the link with your submission.
